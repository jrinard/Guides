WARNING LOG TO INVESTIGATE
Joshuas-iMac:~ MYNAME$ rvm install 2.5.1
Warning! PATH is not properly set up, /Users/MYNAME/.gem/ruby/2.5.1/bin is not at first place.
         Usually this is caused by shell initialization files. Search for PATH=... entries.
         You can also re-add RVM to your profile by running: rvm get stable --auto-dotfiles
         To fix it temporarily in this shell session run: rvm use 2.5.1
         To ignore this error add rvm_silence_path_mismatch_check_flag=1 to your ~/.rvmrc file.
Searching for binary rubies, this might take some time.
No binary rubies available for: osx/10.14/x86_64/ruby-2.5.1.
Continuing with compilation. Please read 'rvm help mount' to get more information on binary rubies.
