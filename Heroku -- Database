2-5-2022 Transfered Database from old crm-jr to crm-rmedia    : https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-backups

1. PRE WORK
    Made second app at new domain and setup database columns to match. Not sure if it was required but that is what I did.
2. MAKE BACKUP on old capp
    heroku pg:backups --app crm-jr
3. GET INFO - which includes database name in this case the first database is DATABASE - b441 is the backup
    heroku pg:backups:info b441 --app crm-jr
4. Restore backup to new site. (DATABASE_URL was actually used because the first database is named that. Afterwords they give it a color)
       heroku pg:backups:restore crm-jr::b441 DATABASE_URL --app crm-rmedia

At this point it was done.

5. Extra Commands of notes

    Restore database from backup
    heroku pg:backups:restore b441 DATABASE_URL --app crm-jr
